6 Main Interfaces(Objects)
-Script
-Project
-Gradle
-Settings
-Task
-Action

These interfaces implements methods and properties e.g logger,resources which can be used while building
your own gradle Script

Gradle lifecycle Phases
-Initialization - scripts in init.d folder of .gradle, init.gradle, settings.gradle
-Configuration - build.gradle
-Execution - build.gradle

-Every property declared in the Initialization can be used throughout the gradle lifecycle
-files placed in ${USER_HOME_DIRECTORY}/.gradle/init.d runs in an alphabetical order of their name (check eclipse/gradlestart project for the same)

Gradle Object Model
-Gradle is the top level object which every other object e.g project,settings,script etc implements.
-A script running in Initialization phase can delegate to gradle object.
-Every build script running in Configuration phase instantiates a script object which inturn delegates to another object which depends on the phase in 
 which it runs.
-If a build script is running in configuration phase it delegates to project object.
-In case of a multiproject build a script also settings object as settings.gradle is the file where the list of projects 
incorporated in the build.The scripts contained in those projects in turn delegate to project object.
-If a script delegates particular object it's delegation is implied i.e if a script is delegating to project then the property "$project.buildFile"
 can be referred just as "$buildFile"
 For more examples refer build.gradle of minGradleRequirements

Properties
- gradle domain objects(Script,Project,Settings) have properties on their own.In addition to that user defined properties can be defined in three ways
1) Define properties in gradle.properties file in key=value format,this properties are accessible in both build.gradle as well as settings.gradle
2) Pass the properties through gradle command with ahead of command line option -P e.g gradle -PsampleProperty=sampleValue (no space between -P and argument declaration, strange :P)
3) Declare the property in the gradle script itself e.g a timestamp value for project can be set using property such as 
`project.ext.timestamp= some value or closure` in the build script of that project.
