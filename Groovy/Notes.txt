Groovy is a DSL-Domain Specific Language

Does away with semicolons, not a compulsion
Almost similar to Java in Coding
Compatible with Java-- See javacompatiable groovy program
def == object
So def data= new Date() is equivalent to Object data= new Date() 

Groovy is a dynamic language.
So type compatibility is checked at runtime rather than at compile time, like Java

String interpolation is allowed in double quoted strings. Not allowed in a single or triple quoted string
because they are interpreted as a plain string.

Properties equivalent to java bean i.e instance variables wrapped by getters and setters.It's provided out of box
See properties.groovy for reference
